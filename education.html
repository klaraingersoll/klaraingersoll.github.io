  Cambridge Rindge and Latin is where my interest in developing solutions to issues of inequality started.
  <br> I founded and led a feminism club 'Club 1,' to address sexism and misogyny on campus, by

  providing reuseable water bottles with a bottle-up logo (which I designed) to each student as well as making &amp;
  airing informational videos on reducing plastic waste
  to promote health and sustainability on campus.
