</h1>
<p>
  I am working with <a href="https://www.period.org"><u> 'PERIOD. The Menstrual Movement'</u></a> to develop a long-term
  social media plan for their Instagram &amp; visual media more broadly. I took over their Instagram during a week-long themed campaign,
  posting custom graphics, photos, and videos that I produced <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BW8mBnthCTX/?taken-by=periodmovement">
  (<u>such as this one</u>)</a>. I was also a coordinator for their 'Period Stories' series; a social media campaign to normalize
  talking about menstruation and represent the incredible diversity in people's experiences with their periods.
  Recently named the 'Leader' of the 'Menstrual Movement;' PERIOD is a non-profit providing menstrual products to people who
  cannot afford them, and working to end the stigma around menstruation through education and advocacy.

  <br><i> Summer 2017 </i>
</h1>
<p>
  I am working with Cambridge Public School's Social &amp; Emotional Department to develop gender dynamics training focusing on male
  students to help prevent sexual harassment and assault. The city is investing in this training because the student feminist
  oalition, "Club 1," which I started and led, organized a school-wide Walkout (covered in multiple local newspapers),
  calling for a wide-set of changes in policy and culture through education and trainings. After being on the committee
  to rewrite the policy, I wanted too follow up on this activism through educational programs that would impact real tangible
  changes to student culture.

<p>
  I served on the committee to create a Sexual Harassment &amp; Assault Policy for the University of King's College.
  The committee created a survivor &amp; student centric sexual violence policy with references to best practice policies of York University,

</h1>
<p>
  Greta Hamilton and I received a grant from King's to renovate and create an art gallery and performance space out of a laundry room.
  The show featured works by students at King's and the Nova Scotia College of Art &amp; Design and was centered around the theme of
  Hannah Arendt's notion of politics as we engaged in the process of making the formerly Private Realm (laundry room) Public
  (art gallery) and therefore Political: making what was formerly seen as Labor, now seen as Art. We held a public gallery
  opening for the larger community to come together and view the art and celebrate the gallery launch, featuring local bands.

  <br><i> Winter 2016 - Spring 2017 </i>
</h1>
<p>
  Modulating Mansion is an underground community arts space in Halifax's North End. I have planned fundraisers and shows featuring
  local artists and musicians. I also aimed to make the space more inclusive. I did social research: facilitating conversations
  with  members of the larger arts community in Halifax about their experiences in the space, compiling a plan of action from
  people's grievances and suggestions for improvement. In my action, I both planned my own events which aimed to subvert the
  structures and address people's issues with the space, as well as encouraged the leadership to change and improve.

  problems. Each two-week studio is led by a new set of coaches (innovators and leaders in their respective fields) who suggest
  directions and demand excellence as students brainstorm, design, build, and present their solutions. I spent 8 months as a
  student at NuVu Studio over several years and was offered a chance to work with students as an intern and assistant coach
  during the summer sessions in 2013 &amp; 2014.

  <b><i> Founder &amp; Leader, </i> Club 1, CRLS, Cambridge MA </b>
  <br><i> January 2014 - June  2016 </i>
</h1>
<p>
  My high school, like most other high schools, was missing a safe and focused environment to discuss gender equity issues, so I
  founded the CRLS Feminist Coalition, "Club 1" in the winter of my sophomore year, heading and growing it until I graduated.
  Club 1 quickly became one of the most attended clubs at CRLS. I led weekly workshops on the key building blocks of feminist
  analysis. After our group became an educated constituency, we took on our first issue, which was the school's antiquated dress
  code, disproportionately targeting women of color. After a successful campaign of educating the administrators and faculty,
  the dress code was rewritten.
  <br><br>
  After 'addressing the dress code,' we decided to take on a more challenging issue: sexual harassment and assault on campus,
  and the culture of victim blaming surrounding them. Because this issue was hidden, we wanted to both learn about it and create social
  awareness around it, so we spoke extensively with survivors, conducted online surveys, and held public forums for anyone to share
  experiences with sexual violence in the CRLS community. To pressure the administration to actually implement change, and properly
  enforce Title IX, I led a highly successful Walkout accompanied by a letter listing our demands, signed by hundreds of Walkout
  participants, which we presented to the administration. The Walkout garnered media attention and caused the School Committee to
  request progress reports from the school administration on implementing change. Since, I met frequently with the school principal,
  and the school continues to make progress rewriting their policy and protocol.
